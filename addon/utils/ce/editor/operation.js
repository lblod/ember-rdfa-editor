 * Replaces a DOM node

 * contents.  It should be used as a last resort.
 *
 * Callback is used if the editor can prepare itself for the change.
 * failedCallback is called when the editor cannot execute the
 * change.
 *
 * - domNode: Node which will be altered
 * - callback: Function which should execute the dom node
 *   alteration.  This function receives the DOM node which was
 *   supplied earlier as a first argument.
 * - failedCallback: Function which will be executed if the callback
 *   could not be executed.  It receives the dom Node and an
 *   explanation as to why the execution could not happen
 * - motivation: Obligatory statement explaining why you need
 *   replaceDomNode and cannot use one of the other methods.
