   * @param {string} who Unique id of the plugin for which to

   * plugin doesn't accidentally override another plugin's cards.  A
   * common unique ID to use is the name of the plugin card (see

   * Eg: `editor-plugins/dbpedia-info-plugin`
   *
   * @param {Object} card Hint card to add
   * @param {String} card.card Name of the component to render.  This
   * is commonly the path to your ember component in the
   * source-tree.
   *
   * Eg: `editor-plugins/dbpedia-info-card`.
   *
   * @param {Array} card.location Array indicating the start and end
   * index of the highlight in the document.
   *
   * Eg: `[4,52]`
   *
   * @param {Object} [card.options] Extra settings for the card to insert.
   *
   * @param {Boolean} [card.options.noHighlight] When truethy, the
   * card will be available when the user's cursor visits the
   * location, but the card will not be highlighted.
   *
   * Eg: A date update card does not require immediate user action and
   * so should not be highlighted, but when the cursor is inside the
   * date we do want to show a date update card.
   *
   * @param {Object} card.info Information object supplied to the
   * component in the `@info` argument when rendering the hint card.
   * Anything your component needs should be supplied through this
   * info object.
   *
   * Eg: For plugins which manipulate the document you'll want to pass
   * the hrIdx, editor interface and hintsRegistry plus maybe some
   * other information detected earlier such as a matched term.
