  /**
   * Updates a selection as described above.
   *
   * Indication of content to change comes in three levels.  The
   * interface is easy to use, but explaining is somewhat strange.
   * Check the example below if you are getting started.
   *
   * When writing plugins it is often not very clear in which
   * circumstances the plugin could be triggered.  It is easy to
   * imagine your immediate use case but a myriad of others may work
   * as well.  This API lets you provide as much information about the
   * intended consequence as possible and it will do its best to
   * create a document that abides your request based on the input.
   * It is always smart to doublecheck the output for your intended
   * use-cases.
   *
   * The specification interface consists of three levels which can
   * roughly be combined at will.  First level most broadly indicates
   * if you want to add or remove information.  Second level lets you
   * indicate the information which needs to change, third level
   * indicates the changed content.  Not all combinations are sensible
   * and rarely needed ones may not be implemented yet.
   *
   * **First level** indicates whether we are setting, removing or
   * adding context:
   *
   * - `add`: adds semantic content to the document leaving current
   *     semantics is place.
   * - `remove`: removes semantic content from the document, leaving
   *     other semantic content in place.
   * - `set`: sets semantic content on the document, overriding
   *     existing semantic content.  This is less preferred as it may
   *     overwrite semantic content of other plugins.
   * - `before`: inserts the content explicitly before the selected
   *     entities.
   * - `after`: inserts the contents explicitly after the selected
   *     entities.
   * - `append`: appends the supplied content to the existing content
   *     inside of the selection.
   * - `prepend`: prepends the supplied content to the existing content
   *     inside of the selection.
   *
   * **Second level** describes what you want to manipulate.  This set
   * contains both semantic content as well as html content.
   * Currently in scope are:
   *
   * - `property`: Describing the relationship (as per html/RDFa
   *     `property` attribute).
   * - `typeof`: Describes the type of the contained element (as per
   *     html/RDFa `typeof` attribute).
   * - `dataType`: Describes the datatype of the supplied value (as
   *     per html/RDFa `dataType` attribute).
   * - `resource`: The resource to be considered (as per html/RDFa
   *     `resource` attribute).
   * - `about`: Like resource, creates a scope for the resource to be
   *     considered (as per html/RDFa `about` attribute).
   * - `content`: The content attribute to be considered (as per
   *     html/RDFa `content` attribute).
   * - `attribute`: TODO/FUTURE we intend to extend this for other
   *     attributes.
   * - `innerContent`: TODO/FUTURE set the inner content of the
   *     selected HTML tag.  Although a bare implementation exists, this
   *     should be extended in the future.
   * - `innerHTML`: Sets the innerHTML of the element.  Be wary of
   *     this option, it may override semantics inside of the node you
   *     are treating.  Always supply an `operation.desc` when using
   *     this as it may be hard to debug after the fact.
   * - `tag`: Indicates the HTML tag which should be used for
   *    `append`, `prepend`, `before` or `after` edits.  Value must be
   *     a string.
   * - `forceNewContext`: Indicate that a new wrapping or nested
   *     context should be created. Only available on `add`.
   *
   * **Third level** supplies content to be removed or content to be
   * set.  As such either a selection or a change can be made.
   * Selections are executed when removing content, new content works
   * for setting (`set`) or adding (`add`) content.  The third level
   * is the value of the property in the most deeply nested object.
   *
   * - `true`: A /selection/ which indicates all content.  Explicitly
   *    setting true will remove all content.
   * - `string`: A value of type string indicates a single value to be
   *    set/added/removed.  This is the most common case. If no value
   *    matches, nothing is removed.  For semantic content,
   *    translation is done based on the current context, eg: if there
   *    is a `foaf:name` in the document, then suppling the string
   *    `"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"` will usually mean
   *    `foaf:name` is matched based on RDFa semantics and
   *    conventions.  This is the only option for the `tag` property.
   * - `[string]`: An array of stings indicates multiple specific
   *    values to be set/added/removed. Matching works the same way as
   *    string.
   * - `regex`: FUTURE A /selection/ which indicates anything matching this
   *    regular experession should be removed.
   * - `[regex]`: FUTURE A /selection/ which indicates anything matching any
   *    of these regular expressions should be removed.
   *
   * NOTE: the behaviour of `add` or `remove` could be different based
   * on which sort of thing you want to update.  Not all combinations
   * may be supported in case we cannot make sense of them (eg:
   * Removing `innerHTML` may be error-prone) and some may not be
   * supported yet.
   *
   * NOTE: The system is free to set or add properties based on a
   * short form (derived from the prefixes available in the context)
   * if it is possible and if it desires to do so.
   *
   * NOTE: forceNewContext is set to undefined by default.
   * This is because we assume that when you don't
   * care about the context there's a fair chance that we can merge
   * the contexts. In specific cases you may desire to have things
   * explicitly control where a new context is created.
   * In those cases you should set either 'WRAP' or 'NEST'.
   *
   * NOTE/TODO: In order to make plugins simpler, we should look into
   * specifying namespaces in the plugin.  By sharing these namespaces
   * with these setter methods, it becomes shorter te specify the URLs
   * to match on.
   *
   * NOTE/TODO: It is our intention to allow for multiple operations
   * to occur in series.  Altering the range in multiple steps.  This
   * can currently be done by executing the alterSelection multiple
   * times.  Connecting the changes this way does require you to make
   * a new selection each time you want to execute a new change.  If
   * this case occurs often *and* we can find sensible defaults on
   * updating the selection, we could make this case simpler.  The
   * options hash would also allow an array in that case.
   *
   * @method update
   * @param {Selection} selection Region to operate on, as returned by
   *  the selectContext or selectHighlight methods.
   * @param {Object} operation The intended changes on the document.
   *  You can either add annotations, remove annotations or specificly
   *  set the annotations.  Most plugins use add/remove as that has
   *  less chance to conflict with unexpected situations.
   *
   * @param {String} [operation.desc] You are encouraged to write a
   *  brief description of the desired manipulation here for debugging
   *  needs.  Especially when using set and even more when setting
