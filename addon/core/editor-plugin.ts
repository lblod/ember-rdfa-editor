 * It defines a set of primitive operations with which the document state can be queried and changed.
 *
 * Plugins use these primitives to actually implement the desired user-facing behavior and UI.
 * Some plugins are developed right in the rdfa-editor repo and can be considered "internal" plugins.
 * There is however no real distinction between them and "external" plugins,
 * they use the exact same interface to do their thing.
