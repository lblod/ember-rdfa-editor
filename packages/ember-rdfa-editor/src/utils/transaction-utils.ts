/**
 * In simple terms, a transaction monad takes a state and builds a transaction and returns it.
 * We return a {@link TransactionMonadResult} here instead to allow for some flexibility regarding failure values.
 * It's generic in the result type, although it's most common to just use a boolean for a simple success/failure workflow.
 *
 * The reason for this particular shape is it's resemblance to monads from functional programming languages, which can be easily
 * chained. It's also relatively intuitive: start from a state, return what you wanna do with the state.
 *
 * By starting from a raw state instead of appending to a pre-existing transaction, these monads can be made much more generic
 * cause they can assume they start from a clean state and are in full control of the transaction they return (aka they don't need to
 * worry about previous steps)

 * Builds a function that can chain {@link TransactionMonad} functions together.

 * all operations.
 *
 * You can also optionally pass an initialtransaction, which is required to be made from the same state you pass as initialState.
 * This initial transaction will simply be processed before the monads are applied. This is handy in commands, where you usually
 * already have a transaction and you don't realy want to be forced to write a monad function.
 *
 * The combination happens by appending all the steps of each transaction to an "accumulator" transaction, a bit similar to a
 * reduce function.
 *
 * WARNING: the combinator does NOT carry over any selection changes, storedMarks changes, or metadata changes from the given transactions.
 * The logic to correctly carry over selections was simply too complex. Instead, the return value carries the full array of transactions
 * that were applied in sequence, so that calling code can restore any potentially lost state if needed.
 * It is however recommended to write transactionMonads in such a way that they only deal with document transforms.
 *
 * @param initialState the state to start from
 * @param initialTransaction optional initial transaction. If given, it must be made from the same state as you pass to initialState
 * @param transactionMeta metadata to be set on the transactions produced by the combination process
