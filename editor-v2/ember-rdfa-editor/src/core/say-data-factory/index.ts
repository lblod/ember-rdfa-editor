/**
 * Data factory implementation based on https://github.com/rubensworks/rdf-data-factory.js
 * This data factory extends the RDF.DataFactory implementation with support for custom prosemirror-specific terms.
 * Additionally, the `equals` method on the different term implementations is implemented as an arrow function,
 * rather than as a prototype method, in order to support object spreading.
