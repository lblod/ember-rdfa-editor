# an alternative is to set this to true, remove the sync scripts (cause it will no longer work),
# and make sure the peerdeps of the test-app and the addon are always in sync.
# worth a read: https://pnpm.io/npmrc#dedupe-injected-deps
# the second option works as well, but it seems to cause triple browser refreshes on every
# code change, so this seems like a better option for now...
